# 🔎 Search, Filter & Actions Update

I have enhanced the Retailer Dashboard with advanced search, sorting, and action capabilities as requested.

## 1. 📄 Optimized Bills Tab
- **Search**: You can now search by **Customer Name**, **Mobile Number**, or **Bill ID**.
- **Sort**: Added dropdown to sort bills by:
  - 📅 **Date** (Newest/Oldest)
  - 💰 **Amount** (Highest/Lowest)
- **Instant Filtering**: Results update in real-time as you type.

## 2. 👥 Enhanced Customer Folders
- **Search**: Added a search bar to instantly find customer folders by **Name** or **Mobile**.
- **Action Buttons**: Inside each customer folder ("View Customer Folder" modal), every bill in the history now has action buttons:
  - 👁️ **View**: Open full bill details.
  - 🖨️ **Print**: Print the bill directly.
  - 📤 **Share**: Share bill via WhatsApp.

## 3. 🚀 How to Use
1. **Go to Bills Tab**: Type "Rahul" or "999" in the search box to find specific bills.
2. **Go to Customers Tab**: Search for a customer folder instantly without scrolling.
3. **Open a Folder**: Click on a customer folder -> You will see their bill history with the new **Action Buttons** next to each bill.

The system is now fully searchable and actionable.
